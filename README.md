# Joint_Distribution_Probability_In_Python
Practical demonstration of joint probability distribution with visualizations and analysis using Python.


ðŸ“Š Introduction to Joint Distribution â€“ Practical


This project provides a practical introduction to Joint Probability Distribution using Python. 


It demonstrates how to represent and analyze the probability of multiple random variables occurring together, along with visualizations for better understanding.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective


Understand the concept of Joint Probability Distribution

Represent probabilities for two or more random variables

Represent probabilities using a 2D table or matrix

Compute:

Joint probabilities

Marginal distributions

Conditional probabilities



Visualize relationships using heatmaps, bar plots, and distribution plots

Explore marginal and conditional probabilities
